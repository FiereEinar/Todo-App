# Todo-App

Todo app created in order to practice JavaScript.

[Live Demo](fiereeinar.github.io/Todo-App-Site/)

## Silly thing

I didn't know you can insert html code in js by putting it in backticks

``` JavaScript
const myComponent = (parent) => {
    parent.innerHTML = `
        <div>
            <h1>
                Hello World!
            <h1>
        <div>
    `
}
```

So yeah, renderer.js looks horrendous

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/FiereEinar/Todo-App.git
cd Todo-App
npm install
npm run live
```
